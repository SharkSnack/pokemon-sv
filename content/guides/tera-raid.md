Tera raids are one of the multiplayer features in Pokemon SV where a group of up to 4 players battle a boss pokemon.

# Mechanics

## Terastallization

[Image]

Each player gains the option to Terastallize after they land a damage dealing move 3 times.<br/>However, some bosses will reset the Terastallization charge during battle based on remaining HP or time.<br/>If you plan on Terastallizing, select it quickly once it becomes available in case the charge gets reset.

Details:

- Defensive typing becomes the tera type.
- Still has STAB (x1.5) on base type moves when attacking.
- Gains STAB (x1.5) on tera type moves if different than base type.
- Gains Tera-STAB (x2.0) on tera type moves if same as base type.
- Unlike Dynamax in Sword / Shield, stats remain the same.

Examples:

1. Garchomp (Ground/Dragon) → Tera Steel → regular STAB Iron Head, regular STAB Earthquake / Outrage.
2. Garchomp (Ground/Dragon) → Tera Ground → no STAB Iron Head, Tera-STAB Earthquake / regular STAB Outrage.

## Time Limit

[Image]

The time limit for raids is:

- 5 minutes for ★1~5
- 7 minutes 30 seconds for ★6
- 10 minutes for ★7

Each time a player-controlled pokemon faints, a penalty is subtracted from the remaining time.

- The penalty seems to depend on the pokemon's level, with a higher level having a bigger penalty.
- A Lv100 pokemon fainting in a 6 star raid seems to be around -60 seconds.

## Cheers

[Image]

Cheers are special actions that can be used up to 3 times per player.

#### Go All Out!

Effect: Boost Attack and Sp.Atk of the entire party for 3 turns. (JPN sources say it's around x1.3 ~ x1.5)

- The boost is separate from stat stage modifiers and abilities like Swords Dance, Belly Drum, Quark Drive, etc.
- Does NOT stack if used multiple times - Using it while it's already in effect extends duration by 1 turn.
- Does NOT get wiped by raid boss when it wipes ally stat modifiers and abilities.

#### Hang Tough!

Effect: Boost Defense and Sp.Def of the entire party for 3 turns. (Multiplier hasn't been tested)

- Hasn't been tested so multiplier is unknown, but it probably functions like Go All Out!

#### Heal Up!

Effect: Restore HP to the entire party, and cure all status conditions.

- Amount of HP restored seems to be random.

## Shield

[Image]

Raid bosses can activate a shield when remaining time or the boss's remaining HP gets low.<br/>The activation thresholds vary by pokemon, but for 6 stars it's generally 50\~75% HP or 55% remaining time.

Details:

- Reduces damage received from non-Terastallized pokemon to 20% the normal amount.
- Reduces damage received from Terastallized pokemon to 75% the normal amount.
- Blocks all non-damage moves such as Taunt, Screech, and Thunder Wave.

## Status Reset

[Image]

The raid boss can occasionally reset the status of themselves or your party.<br/>These effects are triggered based on remaining time or the boss's remaining HP.

#### Ally Side

Stat modifiers from moves like Swords Dance are reset, and the pokemon's ability is disabled for 1 turn.<br/>It does NOT wipe field effects such as Reflect, Light Screen, Electric Terrain, or cheers.

#### Enemy Side

Negative stat modifiers are set to initial values, and status conditions are cured.<br/>
It does NOT reset the boss's ability after it's been skill swapped or erased by Gastro Acid.

## Turns

Player turns are not synchronized - It's possible for player A to act multiple times before player B.<br/>The boss uses a move when an ally side player uses a move or cheers - If you don't act, the boss is unlikely to attack you.<br/>The boss uses additional moves based on remaining time or the boss's remaining HP.

# Basics

This section is written with online play in mind.

## Base Type

When choosing a pokemon for a raid, pay attention to the boss's base types - NOT just the Tera type.<br/>The boss still has STAB on moves of its base types, so choosing something weak to those will likely end in failure.

- Bad: Choosing Gengar who is weak to Ground type moves against a Tera-fairy Garchomp.
- Good: Choosing Ceruledge who is immune to Fighting and has Flash Fire against a Tera-water Tauros (Blaze Breed).
    - ★6 Tauros (Blaze Breed) doesn't know Tera Blast, so you're immune to all of its attacks.

## Don't Faint

[Image]

The timer penalty in ★6 raids can be as high as 1/7 of the remaining time (\~60 seconds), so it's important to stay alive.

- Support pokemon should use Reflect or Light Screen before other allies act, unless they need to Taunt or Skill Swap.
    - Moves such as Chilling Water and Mystical Fire can also be used to reduce damage received.
- 1 player should use the Hang Tough! cheer right away to reduce damage received for 3 turns.
- Inflicting burn on a physical attacker boss can be effective, but remember that it'll likely be cured during battle.
- Keep an eye on your party's HP, and use Heal Up! if someone is about to faint or you need to cure status conditions.
- If the boss's HP and remaining time are both low and you're about to faint, DO NOT select a move.
    - The boss is unlikely to attack you as long as you don't act, so trust your teammates to finish it off.

## Team Play

[Image]

Raids go more smoothly when each player plays off of each other, instead of trying to solo the fight.<br/>Watch the party status in the upper left corner to see what moves other players are using.

Examples:

- If you're an attacker and there's a support pokemon, wait a few seconds to see if they use Reflect or Light Screen,<br/>making it safer for you to use Belly Drum or otherwise act at the start of the battle.

- If allies are using moves like Screech, Fake Tears, or Metal Sound, DO NOT immediately attack the boss.<br/>They might be setting up for a one-shot, so use Hang Tough! or Go All Out! and wait until after debuffs.<br/>Mindlessly attacking will just trigger the shield and slow the entire raid down.

- Use flexible party-oriented builds and be willing to switch roles if needed, even if you deal less damage for a bit.<br/>Example 1 - If you're a Flutter Mane, use Mystical Fire instead of Calm Mind so all players gain an advantage.<br/>Example 2 - If you're an Iron Hands, run Electric Terrain for party sleep immunity + Quark Boost activation.

## Buffs and Debuffs

★6 bosses have 2500 HP and shields cover between 25\~40% depending on the boss (upwards of 1000 HP).<br/>Therefore, immediately attacking without buffs or debuffs and risking shield activation is a terrible idea.<br/>It's best to boost attackers and weaken the boss and aim for a one-shot if possible to skip the shield.

## HP Recovery

In most cases, reducing the amount of damage the party takes is a higher priority than healing HP.<br/>If the boss is dealing 50%+ damage to the party, healing 25% HP with Life Dew won't outpace damage received.<br/>Instead, use Reflect, Light Screen, Mystical Fire, Chilling Water, Will-O-Wisp, Hang Tough!, etc. to reduce damage,<br/>then <u>anyone</u> can use Heal Up! to regroup.

Moves that both deal damage and heal HP are great, since you're still working toward the objective.<br/>Self-recovery moves like Morning Sun, Recover, and Shore Up can be good depending on the build.<br/>Heal Pulse restores 50% HP, so it can come in handy to keep a buffed attacker alive in emergencies.
